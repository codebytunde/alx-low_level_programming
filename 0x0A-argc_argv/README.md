# ALX Low-Level Programming - argc and argv

This repository contains a collection of C programs that utilize the `argc` and `argv` command-line arguments. These programs perform various tasks, demonstrating their practical applications.

## Task 0: What's in a Name?

This program prints its own name, allowing it to adapt to a new name without requiring recompilation. The path preceding the program name is retained.

## Task 1: Count Your Arguments

This program counts and prints the number of arguments passed to it.

## Task 2: Listing Arguments

This program prints all the arguments it receives, each on a new line, including the first one.

## Task 3: Multiply and Conquer

This program multiplies two numbers and prints the result. It handles both positive and negative integers.

## Task 4: Adding Up Positives

This program adds positive numbers passed as arguments and prints the result. It also handles cases where no numbers or invalid symbols are provided.

## Task 5: Minimal Change

This advanced program calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount of money.

These tasks showcase the versatility of `argc` and `argv` in C programming, offering practical solutions to various challenges involving command-line arguments.
